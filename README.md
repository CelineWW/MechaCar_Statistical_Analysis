## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

The MechaCar_mpg.csv file is imported and read into a dataframe (5 pt)
An RScript is written for a linear regression model to be performed on all six variables (10 pt)
An RScript is written to create the statistical summary of the linear regression model with the intended p-values (10 pt)

Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils


The Suspension_Coil.csv file is imported and read into a dataframe (5 pt)
An RScript is written to create a total summary dataframe that has the mean, median, variance, and standard deviation of the PSI for all manufacturing lots (10 pt)
An RScript is written to create a lot summary dataframe that has the mean, median, variance, and standard deviation for each manufacturing lot (10 pt)

The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils

In your MechaCarChallenge.RScript, write an RScript using the t.test() function to determine if the PSI across all manufacturing lots is statistically different from the population mean of 1,500 pounds per square inch.
Next, write three more RScripts in your MechaCarChallenge.RScript using the t.test() function and its subset() argument to determine if the PSI for each manufacturing lot is statistically different from the population mean of 1,500 pounds per square inch.

An RScript is written for t-test that compares all manufacturing lots against mean PSI of the population (5 pt)
An RScript is written for three t-tests that compare each manufacturing lot against mean PSI of the population (10 pt)

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition

two-sample t-test?

Write a short description of a statistical study that can quantify how the MechaCar performs against the competition. In your study design, think critically about what metrics would be of interest to a consumer: for a few examples, cost, city or highway fuel efficiency, horse power, maintenance cost, or safety rating.
In your description, address the following questions:
What metric or metrics are you going to test?
What is the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis?
What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why?


A metric to be tested is mentioned (5 pt)
A null hypothesis or an alternative hypothesis is described (5 pt)
A statistical test is described to test the hypothesis (5 pt)
The data for the statistical test is described (5 pt)
What data is needed to run the statistical test?
